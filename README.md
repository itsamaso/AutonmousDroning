<h1 align="center"> Mini Drone Simulation </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

_Welcome to the Mini Drone Simulation project! This repository is dedicated to the development and simulation of an autonomous mini drone. The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive simulation environment where the drone can navigate autonomously using a variety of sensors and control algorithms._

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- _To simulate an autonomous mini drone capable of navigating complex environments._
- _To develop and test control algorithms for stable and efficient flight._
- _To implement RTH (Return To Home) functionality._
- _To create a flexible simulation environment for future enhancements and experiments._

<h2>Brief Of Previous Tasks</h2>

- _Recognizing objects during a flight._
- _Autonmously navigating a drone to its destination._
- _Waypoint application to track drone & flight info in real-time._
